# "Mechanical Defense 2 - mechanical walls" (MD2)"


This mod aims to add new and wonderful technologies for your colony to utilise. From autonomous droids to do your every bidding to coal-burning power generators, you'll find all your technological thirsts satiated here! This mod incorporates a modular structure, meaning there are many different independent modules that you can choose from, so that you can play with the features that you want and leave out the ones you don't. Just remember that all modules require MD2Base to be installed and loaded before them in order to work.

**Mechanical Walls** - walls that be raised or lowered to allow access. (Idea courtesy of this https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=7317.0]post)

# Details:


requires MD2 - base

- adds mechanical walls
- adds 1 research projects for the structure

mechanical walls have 3 states: extended (normal wall), embrasure (you can shoot through), lowered (you can walk through).
to switch between the states you need to power them (take 15 power). if they have no power you can not switch!
